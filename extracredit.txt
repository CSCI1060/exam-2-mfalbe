%First step: At first I will assume that all punctuation is supposed to be
%punctuation or at least not converted to text.
%Therefore, I look at L. If L is a word it probably has to either be A or
%I, So try those conversions.

%My first guess, which was easiest and quickest was to change L to I. This
%gave me a message I was satisfied with, using our written ceasar code.

%function [] = ceasar ( in_filename, out_filename, key)

%inID = fopen ( in_filename, "r")
%if inID == -1
%    error("Could not open input file")
%end

%outID = fopen ( out_filename, "w")
%if outID == -1
 %   error("Could not open output file")
%end

%while 1

%Read one byte at a time
%input = fread( inID, 1)

%if length(input) == 0
  %  break;
%end

%output = input + key


%Write out the output byte
%write( outID, output)

%end

%Close files after we're done with them
%fclose ( inID )
%fclose ( outID )

%end

%Then use the code -3 to change L to I to get translation

ceasar ('encryption.txt', 'translation.txt', -3)

%Raw translation is

%Which we clean up to be

% Gandalf, 'And so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for
